### Creating letters of the English alphabet using CSS.
#### A personal project to test my CSS skills.
This project is to test my skills in the following by creating shapes using;
- ::before and ::after pseudo elements
- border and box-shadow
- relative and absolute positioning
- CSS transforms also.

The goal is to create the 26 unique capital letters and then the small letters once the former has been completed. And through this process, expand my reasoning of finding simplier and easier solutions to each letter shapes I encounter.
